# Propulsion

Triton Rocket Club's Propulsion Team Repository.

## Overview
The Propulsion Team is resposible for designing and manufacturing the propulsion system for all TRC launches. Historically, TRC has created single stage, solid motor rockets to achieve their goals. Starting in Fall of 2016, TRC will begin research into liquid propulsion systems, however, this will remain a research only project until further notice.

## Current Projects
### Intrepid Rocket
* Q-motor
* extimated altitude of 50km
* 7.5s burn time
* Aluminum APCP

### Liquid Propellant Engine
Research phase only.
* Isopropyl Alcohol and Nitrogen Tetraoxide (fuel and oxidize)
* targeting 1000lb thrust
* reneratively cooled
* pressure fed
