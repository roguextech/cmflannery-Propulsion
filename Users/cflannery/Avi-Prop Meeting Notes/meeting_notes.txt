Meeting Notes:

SLV:
- prop may have to take over SLV
- should consider making a two stage rocket
- I will look into the quantitative justification for using a two stage rocket

Second stage:
- good engineering challenge
- mechanical design
- electrical design
- actuators?
- second stage engine can extend into interstage
- interstages are sexy

- actuators are complex
 - they are a good engineering challenge
 
Flight Computer:
- triple redundancy?
- interstage controller
- meche design
 - have people design mechanical enclosuers
- RIOs
 - thermal
 - pducer
 - transmit
 - video
  
- Second stage flight computer:
 - clone of first stage

- This design can be brought to the design review with SpaceX
