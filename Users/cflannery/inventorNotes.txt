   interface will adjust to present tools for your current task
  <Part Modeling Environment/>
  <Assembly Modeling Environment>
   Build and edit 3D assembly models 
   components are referenced in assemblies, part data still lives in part file
  <Assembly Modeling Environment/>
  <Presentation Environment>
   Create exploded assembly views
   record animations
   presentation files reference assembly files
  <Presentation Environment/>
  <Drawing Environment>
   Create 2D drawings of parts and assemblies
   References parts, assemblies, and presentation files.
